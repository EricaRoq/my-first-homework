# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Code Refactor

This project was designed to make this website follow the rules of web accessibility.  It is formulated to help the disabled with viewing the website more clearly.


Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

This codebase follows accessibility standards so that our site is optimized for search engines.
